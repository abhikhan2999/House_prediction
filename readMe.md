# House Prediction using Regression and KNN

## Introduction
This project aims to predict house prices using two different machine learning techniques: Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). By comparing these methods, we can determine which model provides more accurate predictions based on the given dataset.

## Methods

### 1. Data Collection
The dataset used for this project includes various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and location. This data is collected from a reliable real estate source.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
Before applying the machine learning models, the data is cleaned and preprocessed. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

### 3. Regression
Regression analysis is used to model the relationship between the dependent variable (house price) and one or more independent variables (features). We will use multiple linear regression for this purpose.

### 4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
KNN is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. In this project, we use KNN regression to predict house prices based on the features. The algorithm finds the k-nearest data points and averages their values to make a prediction.

### 5. Model Evaluation
Both models are evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. These metrics help in understanding the accuracy and performance of the models.

### 6. Comparison and Conclusion
Finally, we compare the results of the regression and KNN models to determine which method is more effective for house price prediction. Based on the evaluation metrics, we draw conclusions and suggest potential improvements.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of regression and KNN techniques in predicting house prices. By comparing these methods, we gain insights into their strengths and weaknesses, helping us choose the best approach for similar predictive tasks.
